# ATTENTION!

Please be aware I haven't had a chance to order these case files myself.  I'll be testing them out early July and I'll pull down this disclaimer then.  I've made plenty of acrylic style cases and have confidence in these files, but for the time being, order at your own risk.  [Here's](https://imgur.com/IlVzJfS) a picture of the case files aligned with each other and the PCB.

The diameter on the knob cutout is 24.5mm, so go with a knob that's slightly smaller.  If you are building the keyboard using only the included parts, and not ordering the acrylic case files, I recommend a knob no larger than 19.05 mm.  Using a larger knob will have the knob overhanging the edge of the keyboard.  I like Kilo International knobs.
