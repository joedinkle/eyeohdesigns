[Here's](https://imgur.com/IlVzJfS) a picture of the case files aligned with each other and the PCB.

The diameter on the knob cutout is 24.5mm, so go with a knob that's slightly smaller.  If you are building the keyboard using only the included parts, and not ordering the acrylic case files, I recommend a knob no larger than 19.05 mm.  Using a larger knob will have the knob overhanging the edge of the keyboard.  I like Kilo International knobs.
